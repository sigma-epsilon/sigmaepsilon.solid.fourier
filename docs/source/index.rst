The `sigmaepsilon.solid.fourier`_ library offers semi-analytic solutions to some beam and plate 
bending problems, where the boundary conditions are a-priori satisfied by careful selection of the 
approximating functions. Although the calculations only cover a handful of boundary conditions, 
when they are applicable, they are significantly faster than let say a finite element solution. 
For this reason, it is very useful for a couple of things:

* experimentation
* verification
* concept validation
* education
* publication

The implementations in the library all rely on fast and efficient algorithms provided by the goodies of
`NumPy`_, `SciPy`_ and the likes. Where necessary, computationally intensive parts of the code are written
using `Numba`_.
